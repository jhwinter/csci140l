/**
 * Write a program that reads each line in a file, reverses it's lines, and
 * writes them to another file. For example, if the file input.txt contains the
 * lines:
 * 
 * Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary
 * went The lamb was sure to go.
 * 
 * and you run
 * 
 * java reverse input.txt output.txt
 * 
 * then output.txt contains:
 * 
 * The lamb was sure to go. And everywhere that Mary went Its fleece was white
 * as snow Mary had a little lamb
 * 
 * Design your program to get both file names from the command line arguments.
 * Add a check to make sure that the command line arguments contains two file
 * paths. Use a try/catch block to open the files, if an exception occurs then
 * print a friendly message to the user.
